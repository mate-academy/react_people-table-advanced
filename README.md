# React - People table

- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the
  [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/react_people-table-advanced/)
- Follow the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline)

## If you don't use **Typescript**

1. Rename `.tsx` files to `.jsx`
1. use `eslint-config-react` in `.eslintrs.js`

## Advanced tasks

Using code from previous task implement next tasks:

1. Implement `PersonName` component rendering the name as a link to a person using its `slug` property
   ```
   /people/carolus-haverbeke-1832
   ```
   - It should be used for `name`, `mother` and `father` columns
   - Use `blue` for men and `red` women
   - If mother or father were not found in the array by their name show just a name (black, bold) instead of `PersonName` component
1. Highlight the `PersonRow` mentioned in the URL with some background-color
   - Highlight nobody if the `slug` in the URL is not found among the people

### Filtering and sorting

1. Add an `<input>` to filter people by `name`, `motherName` and `fatherName`
   - it should update the URL with `?query=car` where `car` is a string entered by the user
   - Read the `query` from the URL and set its value to the input when the page is loaded
1. `PeoplePage` should read the `query` from the URL and filter people accordingly
   - check is the `query` matches the `name`, `motherName` or `fatherName`
1. Implement the sorting by `name`, `sex`, `born` and `died` by clicking on the column title
   - Highlight the column with the \*
   - Add `?sortBy=born` param to the URL
   - Sort the people by selected column
   - If the page is loaded with `sortBy` it should be applied (column is highilghted and people are sorted)
   - If the `sortBy` value is not valid don't highlight any column and don't sort people

## Advanced sorting and filtering

1. Sort should work together with filtering
1. The `query` and `sortBy` should stay in the URL when you select a user (keep `location.search` on navigation)
1. Implement the ability to sort people in both directions `?sortOrder=asc` or `desc`
   - add [Sort both icon](public/images/sort_both.png) to show that column allows sorting
   - The first click sorts `ascending` (A-Z) the second sorts `descending` (Z-A)
   - add `sort_ask` or `sort_desc` icons accordingly to the applied sorting
1. Update the `query` in the URL with `debounce` of 500ms

## (\* OPTIONAL) Adding a person

1. (\* OPTIONAL) Create a `NewPerson` component with a form to add new people and show it above the table
   - all the fields should be required for now
   - `sex` should be chosen among 2 options (radio buttons)
   - `mother` and `father` are selects with all the `women` and `men` from the table accordingly
1. (\* OPTIONAL) Create an `Add person` button navigating to `/people/new`
   - the `NewPerson` should appear instead of a button
   - When the person is added you should navigate back to the `/people` page
1. (\* OPTIONAL) Add data validations:
   - `name` should contain only letters and spaces
   - `born` and `died` are valid years between `1400` and the current year
   - `died` should be disabled if `born` is empty
   - `died - born` should be >= 0 and < 150
   - make `mother` and `father` field optional
   - update the list of `mothers` and `fathers` according to the entered `born` year (they must be alive)
     (selects should be empty and disabled before the born year was entered)
